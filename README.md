The first notable observation is that the product categories are dominated by Electronics and Home & Kitchen items, as seen in the distribution charts for the first-level categories. These two segments combined account for the majority of products, indicating that they are the most significant areas of focus in the dataset. Subcategories such as Computers & Accessories also feature prominently but to a lesser degree. Additionally, certain categories like Musical Instruments, Toys & Games, and Health & Personal Care are underrepresented, suggesting potential areas for expansion or more targeted marketing strategies.

Within the top 10 subcategories (as shown in the second and third-level category charts), USB Cables and Smartphones lead the way, particularly in the second-level categorization. These categories highlight the importance of accessories and mobile devices in the dataset. The third-level category analysis further reinforces the dominance of accessories, with Cables and Small Kitchen Appliances being the most frequent. This suggests that customers frequently purchase complementary items, emphasizing the importance of cross-selling and bundled offerings.

The boxplot analysis of discount_percentage provided insights into pricing strategies across the dataset. The discounts offered were consistent across a wide range of ratings, typically ranging from 30% to 70%. However, there were no clear trends indicating that higher or lower-rated products received consistently different levels of discounting. This indicates that discount strategies are more likely driven by external factors such as market demand or inventory management rather than customer satisfaction metrics.

Conclusion
The analysis highlights key areas of strength in the dataset, particularly the dominance of electronics and home appliances. Marketing efforts and sales strategies should continue to focus on these core categories, while underrepresented categories offer potential opportunities for growth. Furthermore, the significance of accessories in customer purchasing patterns suggests that bundling these items with higher-priced products could drive further sales. The pricing analysis shows that discounts are applied flexibly across the board, with opportunities for refinement based on specific product performance or rating trends. Lastly, efforts to encourage customer reviews could enhance insights into customer sentiment and help tailor discounting and marketing strategies more effectively.
